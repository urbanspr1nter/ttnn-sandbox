    "Unless you have chosen to train with the `fineweb-100m` dataset, training on a CPU for a GPT-2 355M model over 1 billion tokens is simply not a good use of time and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll leverage **GPU training**. It is _possible_ to do this training on a single GPU within a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have access to a GPU, there are a few good options out there such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lambda Cloud\n",
    "* Fly IO\n",
    "* Linode\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, I used my personal NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of VRAM necessary is dependent upon the batch size. If you have an older card, most likely you'll be using anywhere between 1, 2, or 4 for the batch size. Newer cards can leverage `bfloat16` data type and that significantly reduces the memory necessary to train. You can look to have anywhere from a batch size of 8 to 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "My card supports `bfloat16`, and so do most cloud GPUs now. So the code will be written with that assumption. Adjust the `batch_size` variable as needed when appropriate."
