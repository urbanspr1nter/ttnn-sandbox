    "The amount of VRAM necessary is dependent upon the batch size. If you have an older card, most likely you'll be using anywhere between 1, 2, or 4 for the batch size. Newer cards can leverage `bfloat16` data type and that significantly reduces the memory necessary to train. You can look to have anywhere from a batch size of 8 to 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "My card supports `bfloat16`, and so do most cloud GPUs now. So the code will be written with that assumption. Adjust the `batch_size` variable as needed when appropriate."
