    "First, masking doesn't mean to \"hide\" data from the model. The point of masking is to take some tokens out of consideration when computing the loss, In this case for our training run, we choose the number `-100`. This basically tells PyTorch cross entropy loss function to not penalize us on the tokens that have `-100` as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to maintain the principle that an LLM is to just generate a single token at a time. Repeatedly. Don't focus on getting the model to generate a response, but focus on getting the model to predict the token which can eventually form the response when running the prediction in a loop, over and over again. Eventually, after many token generations, the model will have completely generated a response. It's all an illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Turn Conversations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the single-turn conversation scenario, it's easier to form the dataset and mask. It's simple as just masking everything _not_ the response in the template. Then in every single training batch, the model is tasked to predict only what the response may be, and will only be penalized for its attempts on those tokens. (Error calculation)\n",

      "Assistant: Of course! Are you thinking about planting flowers, vegetables, or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "User: I'm really interested in starting a small vegetable garden. What do you recommend I start with?\n",
      "Assistant: Great choice! For beginners, I recommend starting with vegetables like tomatoes, bell peppers, and lettuce. They're relatively easy to grow and very rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: That sounds good! What should I consider when choosing the location for my garden?\n",
      "Assistant: You'll want to choose a spot that gets plenty of sunlight, ideally 6-8 hours a day. Also, consider access to water and ensure the soil drains well to prevent waterlogging.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: Got it. How should I prepare the soil before planting?\n",
      "Assistant: Start by removing any weeds or grass. Then, you can work the soil by tilling or turning it over with a shovel. Adding some compost can enrich the soil and improve its structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: How often should I water my vegetables once they're planted?\n",
      "Assistant: Typically, vegetables need about an inch of water per week. You'll want to ensure the soil stays consistently moist, but not soggy. It might vary based on your climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: What about pests? How can I protect my garden from them?\n",
      "Assistant: That's a common concern. You can use physical barriers like nets or row covers. Additionally, consider planting companion plants like marigolds which can deter some pests naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: Thanks for the advice. How do I know when my vegetables are ready to harvest?\n",
      "Assistant: Each vegetable has its own indicators. For example, tomatoes turn red when ripe, and lettuce can be harvested once it reaches a reasonable size. Regularly checking on them will help you learn when they're ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: I'm really excited about getting started. Any final tips for a beginner gardener?\n",
