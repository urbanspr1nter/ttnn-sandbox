    "\n",
    "This notebook is independent to the work that we have been doing so far. The goal of this notebook is to just walk through basic dataset preparation for training a bigger GPT-2 model. In this case, we're going to try and train a GPT-2 355M model from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 different types of datasets we can prepare for our model. They are 100M, 1B, 3B and 10B tokens. Use what is best for your system. GPT-2 was trained closer to 10B tokens, so that would get us the best results, but requires a lot of system RAM to hold the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just interested in learning, 100M is good enough to see the difference and produce something somewhat coherent for a 355M parameter model. This requires much less system memory."

    "To get around this memory limitation, I have personally configured my system to have **128 GB** of swap space. Increasing the swap space to utilize it is a trade-off for performance. But it is necessary to do to get this project done if you don't have enough memory. If you are concerned about your SSD health, then you should probably run this notebook on the cloud. I do personally think it is not a big deal though. \n",
