    "While exploring an improved attention mechanism, we'll take advantage in diving deeper in learning and understanding the advantages, and disadvantages of Tenstorrent harware. At some point working through this notebook, you'll probably come to ask \"Why use a TPU when GPUs are already powerful?\", or maybe \"How does a Wormhole n150d compare to high performance CPUs?\" You'll find the discussions on these topics pretty interesting if you've only been exposed to GPU compujte. \n",
    "\n",
    "The true capabilities of specialized hardare like what Tenstorrent provides becomes apparent when you start to compare performance across different architectures. For those familiar with GPU acceleration, the performance benefits of TPUs like the Tensix processor in the Wormhole might seen incremental, or even regressive, but the differences become clear once we start to measure in different perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous implementations of some of the LLM-related techniques and code, we will start by implementing a version using just `torch` to gain understanding. The code, like some previous notebooks is inspired by Sebastian Raschka's LLM From Scratch code."
