# tt-sandbox

## What is this repo?

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with the Tenstorrent TTNN library.

It was meant as a place to just dump a bunch of notebooks and teach myself how to use the Tensix hardware. 

I have a Wormhole n150d, so I created this repo in an attempt to learn how to use it. 

You'll find a lot of scripts and notebooks in exercising some of the `ttnn` functionality. 

Some projects are good, some are bad. Don't laugh, and don't be mad. I'm learning as I go. :)
